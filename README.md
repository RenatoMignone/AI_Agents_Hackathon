# AI Agents - Reply Code Challenge 2026

This repository contains the full learning path, sandbox training materials, and challenge solution workspace
for the Reply Code Challenge 2026 - AI Agents track.

> **Documentation Design Notice**
> All documentation in this repository is written and structured for AI agent readability and token efficiency.
> Every file follows these rules: no emojis, no decorative padding, no redundant prose, no information duplicated across files.
> Each README is scoped strictly to its own folder. Cross-folder navigation is handled through explicit pointer lines only.
> The primary entry point for any AI agent working in this repository is `AI_Agent.md` in this root directory.

## What this repository is for

This is a competition workspace for the Reply Code Challenge 2026, a timed AI agent engineering event.

**Challenge day:** April 16th, 2026 - 6 hours (15:30 to 21:30 CEST)
**Theme:** Monitor. Adapt. Defend.
**Format:** Build an AI agent system that analyzes citizen behavioral data
and identifies anomalous patterns indicating welfare risk.

The repository is organized into three phases that follow the natural progression from learning to competing:

1. **Learning** - Understand the technology stack through four progressive tutorials
2. **Training** - Practice against sandbox datasets that replicate the real competition mechanics
3. **Challenge** - Build and submit the actual competition solution on April 16th

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.10 to 3.13 - Python 3.14 is incompatible with Langfuse, do not use it
- GNU Make (pre-installed on Linux and macOS)
- An OpenRouter API key (free at openrouter.ai)
- Langfuse credentials provided by the challenge organizers on challenge day
- For sandbox training: sandbox keys available on the challenge platform under "View my Keys"

**One-command setup (from the repo root):**

```bash
make
```

This creates the root `.venv/`, installs all dependencies from `.scripts/requirements.txt`, and registers the Jupyter kernel.

**Then configure credentials:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and fill in your real values
```

**Verify everything is working:**

```bash
make check
```

**Launch Jupyter:**

```bash
make jupyter
# or activate manually: source .venv/bin/activate && jupyter lab 00_AI_Agents_Learning/Notebooks/
```

## Learning Path

The 00_AI_Agents_Learning section contains four progressive tutorials. Run them in order:

| #   | Notebook                   | Concepts                                     |
| --- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 01  | Basic Agent Creation       | LangChain, OpenRouter, system prompts        |
| 02  | Tools and Function Calling | @tool decorator, automatic tool selection    |
| 03  | Multi-Agent Systems        | Orchestrator pattern, Agents as Tools        |
| 04  | Resource Management        | Langfuse tracing, session IDs, cost tracking |

See 00_AI_Agents_Learning/README.md for full setup and usage instructions.

## Challenge Overview

The competition uses 5 datasets of increasing complexity. They unlock in two stages:

| Stage | Datasets | Token Budget | Unlock Condition                     |
| ----- | -------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| 1     | 1, 2, 3  | $40          | Available at start                   |
| 2     | 4, 5     | $120 more    | Submit eval solutions for all of 1-3 |

Every submission requires three elements: a Langfuse session ID, a UTF-8 output file, and (for evaluation datasets only) a source code zip.
Training submissions are unlimited and show a score each time. Evaluation submissions are one per dataset and cannot be re-submitted.

See 02_AI_Agents_Challenge/00_How_It_Works/README.md for the full rules, scoring breakdown, prizes, and submission format.

## Makefile targets

| Target                 | What it does                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make` or `make setup` | Creates root `.venv/`, installs all deps, registers Jupyter kernel        |
| `make check`           | Verifies all imports work and .env has all required credentials filled in |
| `make jupyter`         | Launches Jupyter Lab in the learning notebooks folder                     |
| `make clean`           | Removes the root `.venv/` (run `make` again to recreate)                  |

---

## Security

Never commit the .env file. It is excluded by .gitignore.
API keys and Langfuse credentials must be kept private at all times.
The .venv directories are also excluded from version control.

To set up credentials: copy .env.example to .env in the repository root and fill in your values.
All scripts and notebooks use load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) to locate the root .env automatically from any subfolder.
